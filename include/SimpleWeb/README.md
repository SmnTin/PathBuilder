Simple-Web-Server
=================

A very simple, fast, multithreaded, platform independent HTTP and HTTPS server and client library implemented using C++11 and Asio (both Boost.Asio and standalone Asio can be used). Created to be an easy way to make REST resources available from C++ applications. 

See https://gitlab.com/eidheim/Simple-WebSocket-Server for an easy way to make WebSocket/WebSocket Secure endpoints in C++. Also, feel free to check out the new C++ IDE supporting C++11/14/17: https://gitlab.com/cppit/jucipp. 

### Features

* Asynchronous request handling
* Thread pool if needed
* Platform independent
* HTTP/1.1 supported, including persistent connections
* HTTPS supported
* Chunked transfer encoding and server-sent events
* Can set timeouts for request/response and content
* Can set max request/response size
* Sending outgoing messages is thread safe
* Client creates necessary connections and perform reconnects when needed

### Usage

See [http_examples.cpp](http_examples.cpp) or [https_examples.cpp](https_examples.cpp) for example usage. 

See particularly the JSON-POST (using Boost.PropertyTree) and the GET /match/[number] examples, which are most relevant.

### Dependencies

* Boost.Asio or standalone Asio
* Boost is required to compile the examples
* For HTTPS: OpenSSL libraries 

### Compile and run

Compile with a C++11 compliant compiler:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

#### HTTP

Run the server and client examples: `./build/http_examples`

Direct your favorite browser to for instance http://localhost:8080/

#### HTTPS

Before running the server, an RSA private key (server.key) and an SSL certificate (server.crt) must be created. Follow, for instance, the instructions given here (for a self-signed certificate): http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html

Run the server and client examples: `./build/https_examples`

Direct your favorite browser to for instance https://localhost:8080/
